# API Practice

check out this project [here](www.twitter.com/_gg_bot) - some description of what you should be seeing

## Setup: General
There are some things that need to be done before using testing this project. This whole project requires
to have a twitter developer account and spotify developer account. You can choose to only have a spotify 
developer account and run this locaclly without the twitter.py. 

## Setup: Twitter
To get your twitter developer account you can go [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). 
Once you apply you might have to wait to get access. Once you have access you will need to create an 
app on your dashboard. Now that you have your app you can save your access tokens so you can use
those later. One thing to keep in mind is to  enable `read and write` permissions. If you have set
`read only` you can just change the settings on your app dashboard but you will need to reset your
access tokens. 


## Setup: Spotify
